      "description": "The 4:6 method by 2016 World Brewers Cup Champion Tetsu Kasuya is a revolutionary technique that gives you direct control over sweetness, acidity, and strength. The first 40% of water (120g in two 60g pours) controls the balance between sweetness and acidity—equal pours yield balance, adjusting the ratio shifts the profile. The remaining 60% (three 60g pours) determines body and strength. Expect a clean, structured cup with remarkable clarity and the ability to dial in your preferred flavor profile. This method works exceptionally well with washed coffees and medium roasts, producing a balanced cup that highlights origin characteristics without overwhelming complexity. The systematic approach makes it easier to reproduce consistent results once you find your preferred split.",

      "audio_script": "The Tetsu Kasuya 4:6 method is a revolutionary brewing technique that puts you in control. The first 40% of your water—that's the first two pours of 60 grams each—controls the balance between sweetness and acidity. Equal pours give you balance, while adjusting this ratio lets you dial in your preferred flavor. The remaining 60%, split into three pours, determines the body and strength of your cup. Expect a clean, structured coffee with remarkable clarity. This method works exceptionally well with washed coffees and medium roasts, highlighting origin characteristics with consistency and precision."

Adjust the first two pours (40% total) to shift sweetness/acidity balance, and modify the number of remaining pours (keeping 60% total) to control strength.",
