      "description": "Scott Rao's V60 method emphasizes precision and consistency through controlled pouring and minimal agitation. This technique focuses on maintaining bed structure while achieving even extraction. Expect a clean, bright cup with excellent clarity and balanced acidity. The method works particularly well with light to medium roasts, highlighting origin characteristics without overwhelming complexity. The systematic approach of gentle stirring and controlled pouring produces consistent results and helps develop proper brewing technique. This method is ideal for those who appreciate clean, structured coffees with pronounced acidity and clarity.",
