      "description": "James Hoffmann's V60 method is a refined technique that emphasizes precision and control. This method uses a 2:1 bloom ratio (twice the coffee weight) for optimal de-gassing, followed by two main pours that keep the V60 topped up. The technique includes strategic stirring and swirling to ensure even extraction and a flat coffee bed. Expect a clean, bright cup with excellent clarity and balanced acidity. The method works exceptionally well with light to medium roasts, highlighting the coffee's origin characteristics while maintaining consistency. Hoffmann's approach is particularly effective for single-serve brewing, offering a perfect balance between complexity and approachability.",
