      "description": "Kaldi's Coffee V60 method for three people demonstrates how the technique scales beautifully with larger doses. This version uses 48 grams of coffee with a 2.5:1 bloom ratio, requiring a medium grind to prevent over-extraction. The aggressive main pour creates turbulence across the larger coffee bed, while the gentle final pour ensures consistent extraction to 768 milliliters. Expect a clean, balanced cup with good body and clarity, perfect for sharing among three people. The larger dose allows for more complex flavor development while maintaining the beginner-friendly approach. This method works exceptionally well with medium to dark roasts and is ideal for weekend morning coffee sessions with friends or family.",
