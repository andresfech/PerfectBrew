      "description": "Kaldi's Coffee V60 method for two people scales up beautifully while maintaining the same beginner-friendly approach. This technique uses a 2.5:1 bloom ratio with 32 grams of coffee, followed by an aggressive main pour and a gentle final pour to reach 512 milliliters. The larger dose requires slightly coarser grinding to prevent over-extraction. Expect a clean, balanced cup with good body and clarity, perfect for sharing. The aggressive main pour creates turbulence for even extraction across the larger coffee bed, while the gentle final pour ensures consistent results. This method works well with medium to dark roasts and is ideal for morning coffee sessions with a partner.",
