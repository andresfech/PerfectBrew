Maintain that aggressive flow rate to create turbulence in the coffee bed. Watch how the bed rises as extraction begins. This confident pour is the key to V60 success.",

Keep the pour steady and controlled as you work your way up to 256 milliliters total. Watch your scale closely - we want to hit that 256 milliliter target precisely.

Now watch as the coffee bed settles into a nice, flat surface. Let gravity do its work - the coffee will drain down through the filter at its own natural pace. You should finish draining right around the 3-minute mark. And there you have it - a perfect single-serve V60 coffee using Kaldi's method!",
