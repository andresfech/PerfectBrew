      "description": "Kaldi's Coffee V60 method for four people represents the largest scale of this beginner-friendly technique. This version uses 64 grams of coffee with a 2.5:1 bloom ratio, requiring a medium-coarse grind to prevent over-extraction with the substantial dose. The aggressive main pour creates turbulence across the large coffee bed, while the gentle final pour ensures consistent extraction to 1024 milliliters. Expect a clean, balanced cup with good body and clarity, perfect for sharing among four people. The large dose allows for rich, complex flavor development while maintaining the approachable technique. This method works exceptionally well with medium to dark roasts and is ideal for entertaining or large family gatherings where you want to serve excellent coffee to everyone.",
