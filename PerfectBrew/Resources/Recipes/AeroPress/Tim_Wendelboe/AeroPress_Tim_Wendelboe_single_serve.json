    "notes": "Based on the classic recipe used at Tim Wendelboe's café: 14g/200g, near-boiling water, rinsed filter, 60s infusion, stirring and pressing. Adjust the dose if you want more/less intensity (see variants).\n\nWhat to expect:\n\nA clean, sweet, and vibrant cup highlighting the coffee's acidity and clarity.\n\nLight, bright flavor with pronounced fruity and floral notes (especially if using specialty light roasts).\n\nBalanced and nuanced with minimal bitterness and little astringency when brewed with precision.\n\nThis method brings out the best in high-quality beans, letting their origin character shine through. It's ideal for single-origin light to medium roasted coffees.",
