      "description": "The 'Bypass' method involves brewing a strong concentrate and then adding water directly to the final cup. This mimics an Americano and often produces a cleaner, sweeter cup because you aren't forcing all the water through the grounds, which can extract bitterness.",
      "audio_file_name": "bypass_14g_notes.m4a",
      "audio_script": "This recipe uses the bypass technique. By brewing a strong concentrate with only half the water, and then adding fresh water to the cup, we avoid over-extracting the bitter compounds that come out at the end of a long brew. The result is a smooth, sweet, Americano-style coffee."
