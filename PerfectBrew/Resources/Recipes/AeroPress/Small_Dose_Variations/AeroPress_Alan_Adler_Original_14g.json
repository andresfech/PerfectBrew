      "description": "This is the method recommended by Alan Adler, the inventor of the AeroPress. It defies modern specialty coffee norms by using a very short brew time and low water temperature (80°C). The result is a sweet, low-acidity concentrate that mimics espresso strength, intended to be diluted with water (Americano style) or milk.",
      "audio_file_name": "adler_original_notes.m4a",
      "audio_script": "This is the original recipe by Alan Adler, the inventor of the AeroPress. It uses a fine grind, a short brew time, and surprisingly cool water at 80 degrees Celsius. This combination reduces acidity and bitterness, producing a sweet, concentrated shot perfect for diluting with water or milk."

    "notes": "Add hot water to the cup after brewing to make a full cup (Americano), or add hot milk for a latte style drink.",
