        "audio_script": "Alright, now we're ready to start brewing. Place your AeroPress setup on the scale and tare it to zero. Start your timer and begin pouring 200 grams of hot water over the coffee grounds. Pour evenly in a circular motion, starting from the center and working your way outward. Make sure to wet all the grounds - you want complete saturation. This should take about 10 seconds. The coffee will start to bloom and release its gases, which is exactly what we want.",

        "audio_script": "Now, immediately after pouring, take the plunger and insert it about 1 centimeter into the AeroPress chamber. This is crucial - you want to create a partial vacuum seal that will prevent the coffee from dripping through too quickly. Don't press down, just insert it enough to create that seal. This technique is what makes James Hoffmann's method special - it controls the extraction time perfectly.",

        "short_instruction": "Let coffee steep • Wait until 2:00",
        "audio_script": "Perfect! Now we wait for the first steeping phase. The coffee needs to extract for about 2 minutes - that's until the timer reaches 2:00. During this time, the hot water is extracting all the wonderful flavors, oils, and compounds from the coffee grounds. You'll notice the coffee bed has settled and the extraction is happening slowly and evenly thanks to that vacuum seal we created. This is where patience pays off - don't rush this step.",

        "short_instruction": "Gently swirl • 5-10 seconds",
        "audio_script": "Now it's time for a gentle swirl. Hold both the AeroPress and your cup together firmly - you don't want them to separate during this step. Give the whole setup a gentle swirl for about 5 to 10 seconds. This agitates the coffee slurry and ensures even extraction by redistributing the grounds. You'll see the coffee swirling around - this helps break up any channels that might have formed and ensures all the coffee grounds are participating in the extraction.",

        "short_instruction": "Let rest • 30 seconds",
        "audio_script": "After that swirl, we let the coffee rest for another 30 seconds - until the timer reaches 2:30. This brief rest period allows the agitated grounds to settle again and gives the extraction just a little more time to work its magic. You'll notice the coffee has a nice, even color now, and the aroma should be fantastic. We're almost ready for the final step - the press.",

        "short_instruction": "Slow steady press • 20-30 seconds",
        "audio_script": "Now for the final step - the press. Apply slow, steady pressure to the plunger and press it down gradually. This should take about 20 to 30 seconds - don't rush it. You want consistent, even pressure throughout the press. Listen carefully - when you hear a soft hiss, that means you've reached the end and should stop pressing. That hiss indicates that most of the liquid has been extracted and you're starting to compress the coffee bed. And there you have it - James Hoffmann's ultimate AeroPress coffee!",
