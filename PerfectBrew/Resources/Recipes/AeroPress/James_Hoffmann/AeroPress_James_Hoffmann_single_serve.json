The coffee needs to extract for about 2 minutes - that's until the timer reaches 2:00. During this time, the hot water is extracting all the wonderful flavors, oils, and compounds from the coffee grounds. You'll notice the coffee bed has settled and the extraction is happening slowly and evenly thanks to that vacuum seal we created.",

Hold both the AeroPress and your cup together firmly - you don't want them to separate during this step. Give the whole setup a gentle swirl for about 5 to 10 seconds.

This brief rest period allows the agitated grounds to settle again and gives the extraction just a little more time to work its magic. You'll notice the coffee has a nice, even color now, and the aroma should be fantastic.",
