      "description": "The 2021 World AeroPress Champion recipe by Tuomas Merikanto showcases advanced brewing techniques focused on water chemistry and precise temperature control. This method uses Third Wave Water Formula 2 for optimal mineral balance, a low extraction temperature of 80°C to highlight delicate flavors, and innovative manipulation techniques including very gentle stirring and the signature 'pour from altitude' method. Expect a cup with exceptional clarity, bright acidity, and complex flavor layers that highlight the coffee's origin characteristics. The inverted method with precise timing and gentle agitation creates a clean, structured profile perfect for showcasing high-quality single-origin coffees. The final aeration step adds a unique texture and cooling effect that enhances the overall drinking experience.",
