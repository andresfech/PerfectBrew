Two controlled Melodrip pours create even saturation, followed by gentle NSEW stirring and a slow press for a clean, structured concentrate. Final balance is achieved with a warm-water bypass and a touch of 0 ppm room-temperature water. Expect remarkable clarity, refined sweetness, and a balanced, elegant cup that showcases origin character without harshness.",
