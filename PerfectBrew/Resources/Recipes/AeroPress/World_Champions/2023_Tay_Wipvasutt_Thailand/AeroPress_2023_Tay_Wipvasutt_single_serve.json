      "description": "The 2023 World AeroPress Champion recipe by Tay Wipvasutt uses an inverted method with a late coffee addition to refresh aromatics and enhance complexity without over-extraction. The press yields a concentrated base that is carefully diluted in two stages—first with room-temperature water for clarity and temperature control, then with hot water for strength. Expect a clean, fragrant cup with layered sweetness, lively acidity, and a silky texture. The technique highlights aroma retention, balance, and precision suitable for competition and everyday brewing.",
