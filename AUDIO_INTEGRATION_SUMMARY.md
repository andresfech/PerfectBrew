- Path resolution working correctly for World Champions structure

## üìÅ Audio Files Created

| Step | File Name | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | `2021_world_aeropress_brewing_step1.mp3` | Add grounds and first water pour |
| 2 | `2021_world_aeropress_brewing_step2.mp3` | Gentle stirring instructions |
| 3 | `2021_world_aeropress_brewing_step3.mp3` | Continue pouring to 200g total |
| 4 | `2021_world_aeropress_brewing_step4.mp3` | Re-homogenize with gentle stirring |
| 5 | `2021_world_aeropress_brewing_step5.mp3` | Press out air and attach filter cap |
| 6 | `2021_world_aeropress_brewing_step6.mp3` | Place pitcher and flip AeroPress |
| 7 | `2021_world_aeropress_brewing_step7.mp3` | Begin pressing (20 seconds) |
| 8 | `2021_world_aeropress_brewing_step8.mp3` | Swirl and pour from altitude |

## üîß Technical Implementation

### AudioService Changes
- **Enhanced path resolution**: Now searches in `Audio/AeroPress/World_Champions/` structure
- **Multiple fallback paths**: Tries different combinations of folder names and file extensions
- **Debug logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting audio file discovery

### Recipe Integration
- Recipe already contains `audio_file_name` fields for each step
- Audio files match the exact names specified in the recipe JSON
- Timing-based instructions with countdown for precise brewing

## üìã Final Steps Required

### 1. Add Audio Folder to Xcode Project
**CRITICAL**: The Audio folder must be added to the Xcode project for the app to access the files.

**Instructions:**
1. Open `PerfectBrew.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. In Project Navigator (left sidebar):
   - Right-click on "Resources" folder
   - Select "Add Files to PerfectBrew"
3. Navigate to and select the "Audio" folder
4. **IMPORTANT**: Check "Create folder references" (not "Create groups")
5. Click "Add"
6. Verify the Audio folder appears with a **blue folder icon** (blue = folder reference)

### 2. Build and Test
1. Build the project in Xcode
2. Run the app on simulator or device
3. Navigate to the 2021 World Champion recipe
4. Test audio playback for each brewing step

## üéØ Expected Behavior

When the Audio folder is properly added to Xcode:
- Audio files will be included in the app bundle
- AudioService will find files using the path: `Audio/AeroPress/World_Champions/2021_World_AeroPress_Champion_Tuomas_Merikanto_Finland_Inverted/`
- Each brewing step will play its corresponding audio narration
- Audio will include timing instructions and technical details

## üîç Troubleshooting

If audio doesn't play after adding the folder:
1. Check that Audio folder is blue (folder reference) not yellow (group)
2. Verify files appear in Xcode project navigator
3. Check debug console for audio path resolution logs
4. Ensure recipe title matches exactly: "2021 World AeroPress Champion - Tuomas Merikanto (Finland) - Inverted"

## üìä Test Results

```
‚úÖ ALL AUDIO FILES FOUND! Integration should work correctly.
   Total audio files: 8
   Found: 8
   Missing: 0
```

The integration is ready - only the Xcode project setup remains!
